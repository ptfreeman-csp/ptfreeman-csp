### Hi there I'm Patrick ðŸ‘‹
![](imgs/LTM_9613.jpg)

I am a conservation scientist working at the intersection of wildlife and landscape ecology and environmental change as part of the Changing Landscapes Lab at Conservation Science Partners.  


I work on projects ranging from the development of robust and ecologically realistic models that describe species distributions and habitat connectivity to the assessment of conservation value on public lands that can bolster the case for their protection. We deliver robust, forward-looking science that aims to maximize ecological realism and capture the complex dynamics that arise from the interaction between wildlife, human-driven landscape changes, and the ever-increasing effects of climate change. I work with a diverse array of clients across the public and private sectors ranging from federal and state agencies, advocacy non-profits, and citizens groups.

My projects dictate that I work with several coding languages and across many different platforms.
